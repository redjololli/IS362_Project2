1 The 2018 population figures are FBI estimates based on provisional data from the U.S. Census Bureau. See the data declaration for further explanation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 The figures shown in this column for the offense of rape were reported using only the revised Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) definition of rape. See the data declaration for further explanation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 The FBI does not publish arson data unless it receives data from either the agency or the state for six months of at least one of the reporting years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4 Because of changes in the local agency's reporting practices, figures are not comparable to previous years' data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5 The FBI determined that the agency's data were underreported. Consequently, those data are not included in this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6 This agency/state submitted rape data classified according to the legacy UCR definition in 2018; therefore the 2018 rape offense and violent crime total, which rape is a part of, is not included in this report. See the data declaration for further explanation. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
7 Arson offenses reported by the Toledo Fire Department are not included in this report.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
